# Project-4 - Folio <img src='https://i.imgur.com/4Jx5UcI.png' width="80"/>

<h1>Overview</h1>

The Brief for this project was to create a Flask + React Application, utilising the information we had been taught in the week prior. After a successful project 3, I decided to work with 2 of the same students I had worked with on project 3 for this project. We decided on the ambitious concept of creating a Stock & Crypto trading website, allowing users to invest $100,000 of fake money and track their investments.

<h2>Brief</h2>

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use a Python Flask API** using a Flask REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design**
